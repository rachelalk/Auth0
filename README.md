# Auth0
School of Code - Week 10 Hackathon Challenge

This was a really tricky week. We were esentially given the Auth0 documentation and left to figure out how to use it.

Main learning points:

- The actual implementation of Auth0 isn't actually too difficult, the docs are fairly straightforward if you take the time to read them carefully.
- Protected routes is where things get tricky.
- The docs weren't particularly clear on how to access the protected routes once they were set up, setting them up was very straightforward.
- Postman is your friend, this was a really useful tool for trying to access the protected routes before you code it in.
- Bearer tokens aren't easy to access - and so they shouldn't be as they're what you need to access protected data.


We did manage to complete the tasks although it wasn't an easy day.

I also created a basic, auth0 protected page which displays foxes via an API to authenticated users, you can view it <a href="https://fox-fix.netlify.app/">here</a></p> but be warned - it is very orange!
